# 🥗 Calify – AI-Powered Calorie & Macro Tracker

Calify is a minimalist iOS app that uses an LLM (GPT-4o) to estimate calories, protein, carbs, and fat from natural language descriptions of meals. Just type (or speak) what you ate — Calify handles the rest.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input your meal** in plain English  
2. **LLM estimates** total calories and macros using structured prompts  
3. **App scores the estimate's accuracy** and adds it to your daily meal history
